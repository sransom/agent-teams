```

Parallel, worktree-isolated agent teams for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code). Ship a feature by spawning a coordinated team — an explorer maps the codebase and splits the work, implementer agents build in parallel in isolated worktrees, a judge gates merges, reviewers report findings, and the orchestrator integrates and pushes.

Built on top of Claude Code subagents and the [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issue tracker.

---

## Why

One Claude Code session is a single worker. For work that fans out — a migration + API changes + frontend updates, or reviewing a large PR from multiple angles — you want real parallelism with clean boundaries, not a single agent juggling everything.

agent-teams gives you:

- **Isolated worktrees per agent** — no shared-file races, no step-on-toes
- **Dynamic decomposition** — the explorer decides how to split work at runtime based on what the codebase actually looks like
- **Dependency tracking in beads** — `bd ready` drives sequencing; resumable across sessions
- **Model routing** — cheap models for mechanical work (haiku), smart models for judgment (sonnet), optional Codex delegation for ~3x savings on implementation
- **Stack profiles** — `/spawn` auto-detects your repo's stack (Next.js, Deno, Go, Rust, Python, Swift, or generic) and injects the right lint/test/build commands into agent prompts. No hardcoded `npm run lint`.
- **Two commands** — `/build-team` to design a workflow, `/spawn` to run one

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sransom/agent-teams.git
cd agent-teams
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Check for `claude` (required), `bd` (required for orchestration), `codex` (optional)
2. Copy **agents** (5) and **commands** (2) into `~/.claude/` — where Claude Code reads them
3. Copy **formulas** (5) into `~/.beads/formulas/` — where beads reads them
4. Copy **profiles** (8 stack conventions) into `~/.claude/agent-teams-profiles/`
5. Back up anything it would overwrite (`.bak.{timestamp}` suffix)
6. Optionally append a model-routing block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

The split reflects where each tool looks for its files. Both paths can be overridden with `CLAUDE_DIR=...` or `BEADS_DIR=...` env vars if your setup differs.

To remove: `./uninstall.sh`. It asks before deleting modified files and cleans its CLAUDE.md block.

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- [beads plugin](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) — `claude plugin install beads`
- Git with worktree support (every modern version)
- Optional: [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) for cheaper implementer runs

---

## Quick start

### Spawn a team on a feature

```
/spawn
```

Interactive picker: pick a formula, answer a few questions (team name, feature description, base branch), confirm, and go.

Shortcuts:

```bash
/spawn my-auth-refactor                                 # full-team, team=arg
/spawn --formula mol-lite-team                          # pick formula, prompt for vars
/spawn --from-plan ~/plans/migrate-auth.md              # infer feature + plan from file
/spawn --var implementer_model=gpt-4o-mini              # ~3x cheaper (needs codex CLI)
/spawn --resume                                         # pick from teams in flight
/spawn --list                                           # just show formulas, exit
/spawn --dry-run                                        # pour, show DAG, don't dispatch
```

### Design your own team

```
/build-team
```

Wizard walks you through:

1. **Name + description**
2. **Roles** — start from a template (clone `full-team`, `lite-team`, or `code-review`) or pick roles one at a time. Your existing agents in `~/.claude/agents/` show up alongside the built-ins.
3. **DAG** — numbered picks for what each step waits for. Detects "this step probably needs `all-children`" and defaults accordingly.
4. **Variables** — pre-seeded with `team`, `feature`, `repo`; add your own.
5. **Review + save** — plain-English summary, then raw JSON. Edit any part without restarting.

Output: a `.formula.json` in `~/.beads/formulas/` that `/spawn` can run.

## What ships

### Agents (`~/.claude/agents/`)

| Agent          | Model  | Role                                           |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| explorer       | haiku  | Read-only map + arm decomposition              |
| implementer    | sonnet | Execute a plan in a worktree (Claude or Codex) |
| judge          | sonnet | Pass/fail gate on implementer output           |
| test-writer    | haiku  | Write colocated tests                          |
| code-reviewer  | sonnet | P1/P2/P3 report on a diff                      |
| plan-checker   | sonnet | Verify a plan is concrete before dispatch      |

Model names are family aliases (`haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus`) so they track Claude Code's latest defaults. Pin to a snapshot (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`) if you want reproducibility.

### Formulas (`~/.beads/formulas/`)

| Formula           | What it does                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| full-team         | Ship end-to-end: explorer → implementer arms → judge → test + review → integrate                                |
| lite-team         | Same as full-team, minus test-writer. For prototypes.                                                           |
| plan-driven-team  | full-team with a plan-checker prepended + checkbox/progress-log update at integrate. For multi-milestone plans. |
| code-review       | Parallel specialist reviewers. Triage picks reviewers per file type; aggregate dedupes findings.                |
| implement-arm     | Child formula bonded by the explorer. One implementer, one slice of a feature.                                  |
| review-arm        | Child formula bonded by triage. One specialist reviewer.                                                        |

## The `full-team` DAG

```
                  ┌──────────┐
                  │ explorer │   (haiku — maps codebase, bonds arms)
                  └────┬─────┘
                       │ bonds N implement-arms dynamically
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        ▼              ▼              ▼
   ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
   │  arm 1  │    │  arm 2  │... │  arm N  │   (sonnet or gpt-4o-mini)
   └────┬────┘    └────┬────┘    └────┬────┘
        └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                       ▼
                  ┌─────────┐
                  │  judge  │   (sonnet — waits: all-children)
                  └────┬────┘
               PASS    │
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        ▼              ▼              ▼
   ┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
   │  tests  │    │  review  │   │ codex-review  │   (parallel)
   └────┬────┘    └────┬─────┘   └───────┬───────┘
        └──────────────┼─────────────────┘
                       ▼
                 ┌───────────┐
                 │ integrate │   (orchestrator — merge, fix P1s, push)
                 └───────────┘
```

Judge FAIL → reopen failing arm(s), retry (max 3). Escalates to the user after.

---

## Cost lever

The implementer step defaults to Sonnet. You can switch it to Codex (gpt-4o-mini) for ~3x cost savings at similar quality:

```bash
/spawn --var implementer_model=gpt-4o-mini
```

This requires the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed. The implementer agent auto-detects the model type and delegates to `codex exec` when a `gpt-*` model is requested, falling back to native Claude tools if Codex isn't available.

---

## Stack profiles

agent-teams stays stack-agnostic via a `profiles/` directory. Each profile is a short markdown file that tells the agents how to lint, test, build, and commit for a given stack. `/spawn` detects your stack (by scanning for marker files like `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`) and injects the right profile into agent prompts automatically.

Shipped profiles: `nextjs-ts`, `node-ts`, `deno`, `go`, `rust`, `python`, `swift-ios`, `generic` (fallback).

Override with `--profile <name>` if detection is wrong, or drop your own `.md` file into `~/.claude/agent-teams-profiles/` for a custom stack. See [`profiles/README.md`](profiles/README.md).

## Resuming an interrupted session

Agents crash. Laptops close. `/spawn --resume` picks up where you left off — it reads open beads issues, groups them by team name, and lets you pick which team to continue:

```
Resuming — which team?

  [1] auth-refactor  (3 open, 2 in-progress)
  [2] docs-refresh   (1 blocked)

>
```

No re-pouring, no lost work. beads is the source of truth for what's done and what's still owed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent type 'X' not found" after installing

Claude Code snapshots the registered agent list at session start. Newly installed agents (including the five shipped here) won't appear until you **restart Claude Code**. Close the current session and start a new one.

### "formula 'X' not found" when running `bd mol bond`

beads' `bd mol bond` command only resolves formula names that start with `mol-`. All shipped formulas use this convention (`mol-full-team`, `mol-implement-arm`, etc.). If you're writing custom formulas and want them usable with `bd mol bond`, prefix the filename with `mol-`. See `docs/writing-formulas.md`.

### Arm B's lint fails with "cannot find module '@/lib/foo'"

Arm B depends on a file that arm A creates, but B's worktree was branched off `main` before A landed. Merge A's branch into B's worktree before dispatching B:

```bash
cd /path/to/{team}-impl-{arm-b}
git merge agent/{team}/impl-{arm-a} --no-edit
```

If the merge conflicts, that's a real decomposition problem — re-think the arm boundaries.

### Judge returns ready immediately (before arms close)

beads doesn't enforce `waits_for: all-children` automatically — it's a declaration the orchestrator reads and acts on. The orchestrator should dispatch the explorer first, execute its bond commands, dispatch the arms by ID, wait for them to close, then claim the judge. See `commands/spawn.md` Step 5.

### Test runner (vitest) not installed at project root after test-writer runs

The test-writer installs vitest in its own worktree. When the orchestrator merges the test-writer branch into `integration/{team}` and then into `main`, the package.json + pnpm-lock.yaml changes come along, but `node_modules/` does NOT. Run `pnpm install` (or `npm install`) at the project root after merging test-writer's branch — the integrate step should do this automatically. If `npm run build` fails with `Cannot find module 'vitest/config'`, that's the symptom.

### Codex CLI rejects `gpt-4o-mini` with a 400 error

Some Codex CLI installs only accept the model their current subscription allows. If `gpt-4o-mini` fails, try `gpt-5-mini` or `gpt-5.4-mini`. The codex-reviewer step in our formulas uses `gpt-4o-mini` by default, but it's informational only — failure there doesn't block integration.
